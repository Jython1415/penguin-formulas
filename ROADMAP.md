# Penguin Formulas - Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… (Current)
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Create build system to combine individual formula files
- [x] Implement Apps Script loader template
- [x] Migrate UNPIVOT function to new structure
- [ ] Manual testing of complete setup
- [ ] Documentation for end users

## Phase 2: Enhanced Build System
- [ ] Add version tagging and changelog generation
- [ ] Implement JSDoc validation during build
- [ ] Add minification option for production builds
- [ ] Create development vs production build targets
- [ ] Add build caching for faster iterations

## Phase 3: Formula Library Expansion
- [ ] Text processing utilities (CLEAN, NORMALIZE, etc.)
- [ ] Mathematical functions (advanced statistics, finance)
- [ ] Date/time utilities (business days, date ranges)
- [ ] Data validation and type conversion helpers
- [ ] Array manipulation functions (beyond UNPIVOT)

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Automated testing framework for Google Sheets environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Input validation test cases
- [ ] Cross-sheet compatibility testing
- [ ] Error handling validation

## Phase 5: Advanced Distribution Features
- [ ] Multiple distribution channels (stable, beta, alpha)
- [ ] Semantic versioning with dependency management
- [ ] Usage analytics and adoption tracking
- [ ] Automatic rollback on critical errors
- [ ] User notification system for updates

## Phase 6: Developer Experience
- [ ] CLI tool for formula development
- [ ] Local testing environment that mimics Google Sheets
- [ ] IntelliSense/autocomplete support for IDEs
- [ ] Formula debugging and profiling tools
- [ ] Community contribution guidelines and automation

## Future Considerations
- [ ] Integration with Google Workspace marketplace
- [ ] Support for other spreadsheet platforms (Excel, etc.)
- [ ] Plugin architecture for third-party extensions
- [ ] Visual formula builder interface
- [ ] Enterprise features (private distribution, SSO)

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Number of active users and sheets using the library
- **Performance**: Formula execution speed and memory usage
- **Reliability**: Uptime and error rates in production
- **Developer Productivity**: Time to add new formulas and features
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and feature requests

## Risk Mitigation
- **Google API Changes**: Maintain compatibility layers and version testing
- **GitHub Availability**: Implement robust caching and fallback mechanisms  
- **Breaking Changes**: Semantic versioning and deprecation warnings
- **Security**: Regular dependency updates and code review process
